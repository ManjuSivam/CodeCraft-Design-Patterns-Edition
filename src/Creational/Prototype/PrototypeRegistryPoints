Why Use the Creational.Prototype Registry Pattern
1. Efficient Object Creation:
    Reduces the overhead of creating new instances by cloning existing prototypes instead of creating objects from scratch.
2. Avoiding Complex Initialization:
    Simplifies the process of creating objects that require complex setup, configuration, or resource allocation.
3. Consistent Object State:
    Ensures that new objects start with a consistent initial state by copying from a pre-configured prototype.
4. Dynamic Object Management:
    Supports the creation of new objects at runtime without needing to hard-code class names or constructors.
5. Improved Performance:
    Enhances performance by reusing existing objects, especially when the cost of creating new objects is high.

Steps for implementing the Creational.Prototype Registry Pattern:
1. Define a Creational.Prototype Interface:
    Create an interface or abstract class with a clone() method.
2. Implement the Creational.Prototype Interface:
    Implement the prototype interface in concrete classes that need to be cloned.
3. Create a Creational.Prototype Registry:
    Design a registry class to store and manage prototypes.
4. Add Methods to Registry:
    Implement methods in the registry to add, remove, and retrieve prototypes.
5. Retrieve and Clone Prototypes:
    Use the registry to retrieve a prototype and clone it as needed.
6. Use Cloned Objects:
    Utilize the cloned objects in the application as required.
